		<b>Category request for the "category browser" and "category navigator" features:</b><br /><br />

			If you processed the "categories.txt" file, then you don't need to send requests to any server. However, if you don't processed the file just yet, the extension will do request to www.dmoz.org public pages in order to get the subcategories, for filling the submenus. It will also, try to read from www.dmoz.org servers if the category starts with Test/ (because the content of these categories requires authentication).<br /><br />

			<b>Page modifications:</b><br /><br />

			This extension does not modify any pages unless for example you use the 'move site' command in which case the extension will fill the category field and activate the appropriate button.
			<br />
			In summary, this extension will only modify the page when you select that option. In any case, may unintentionally modify some page, because of a malfunction, which I would welcome if you report it.<br /><br />

			<b>License:</b><br /><br />
			Please see the "License" tab.
