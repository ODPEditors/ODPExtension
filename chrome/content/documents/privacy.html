  <font size="2" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">If you have selected RDF in 'Engine used to get info about the site', then the extension will automatically send every visited URL to the selected server, with some exceptions such as private IPs and private URLs like http://development/<br>
    However, if you would like to refrain from this action, you have the option of disabling the command by ticking the 'Disable listings verification'.
    <br>
    Here, you have the option of blocking some domain names, all IPs and the HTTPS protocol.<br>
    It will only send the URLs of HTTP, HTTPS (when deselected), Gopher and FTP protocols.<br>

    <b><font size="2" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Category request:</font></b><br />
    <font size="2" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><s>If you have selected 'Expand saved categories' the extension will send the hovered category in the 'category browser menu' to the selected URL here in order to get subcategories.<br>
    Alternatively  you can skip categories starting with Test or Bookmarks.<br>
    With the default URL the subcategories are retrieved from dmoz.org via godzuki.</s> <br />
    Now, if you processed the "categories.txt" file you don't need to send requests to any server. However, if you don't have processed the file, the extension will do request to www.dmoz.org pages in order to get subcategories. Also, it will send requests to editors servers if the category starts with Test/. The browser will ask for your password because is a non public page. The request is managed completely by the browser, and in any case the password is NOT and not will never administrated, saved or send to any place.<br>

  <font size="2" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">This extension does not modify any pages unless for example you use the 'move site' command in which case the extension will fill the category field and activate the appropriate button.<br />
  In summary, this extension will only modify the page when you select that option. </font><font size="2" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br />
